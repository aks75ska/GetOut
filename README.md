# GetOut
Get-Out is a location based social networking IOS application. 
It helps organize spontaneous meetups of small number of people (2-5) who share a common interest.
The application is generic and meetups can be organized in several areas including sports, movies & entertainment, 
dating, education, social service etc.


# Description
The idea is simple. I create a profile on Get-Out and mention my details. No one can see my profile. No one can search my profile. Then how will other users find me? They find me only when I broadcast.
So, for example, I am planning to go to a theater drama playing at Syracuse Stage. I want to find other people who are interested to go to the same event with me. I broadcast on my app. I can filter people (based on age etc.) who can see my broadcast. When other people near me open their app, they can see my broadcast on their map. If they click on the broadcast, they see my public profile and the details of the activity. If they wish to go with me, they can message me.
I can filter broadcasts on my map. For example, if I wish to see only those broadcasts which are related to sports and games, I can do so.
Users can turn off their broadcasts whenever they wish.


# What it does  
Users must signup and login. They can login using their Facebook or directly through our system.
Users must create a profile including a profile picture, name, description, interests etc.
Users can broadcast a meetup proposal in nearby area, giving details of the meetup. They can filter people who can see their broadcasts.
Users can see other broadcasts on a map which shows only nearby broadcasts. 
They can filter the broadcasts they want see based on their interests.
Users can request to join a meetup if they find it interesting
Meetup organizer can accept one or more requests to join him/her. 
Once they accept the request, the requester can send and receive messages from them till the meetup time expires.
Once the meetup time expires, no messages can be shared on our app. 
The purpose of the app is to connect strangers for the first time. 
It does not facilitate communication between people who already know each other.

# Competitors
The idea is similar to “Meetup” app but with a key difference. 
Meetup application helps plan meetups of large groups on a future date. Get-Out will be more spontaneous. 
It will help people get together in small groups of 2-5 sharing common interests. 
Also, aim of our application is to facilitate meetup on a very short notice.
The main aim of Get-Out is to connect strangers for the first time. 
Our moto is Connect and Forget!
Vast majority of location based social networks focus on dating. Get-Out is different. 
Though it can be used for dating, the focus of the design will be to make it as generic as possible in its use cases.
“Badoo” and “Tinder” are two such examples of location based dating apps which look similar to Get-Out 
but are very different in functionality and purposes.
Target customers of Get-Out can be anyone. Not just teenagers and young adults but virtually anyone!
